Today will be a three part series on **Wrappers**. A wrapper is a generic term used for a class that is created to simplify the interaction with other classes.

There are three types of wrappers I will walk through today.

## Adapter

An adapter is a wrapper class that converts one interface that you cannot/should not change to an interface that your code expects.

## Decorator

A decorator is a way to add functionality to a class without adding that functionality to all instances.

## Facade

A facade provides a simplified interface to more complex functionality.
