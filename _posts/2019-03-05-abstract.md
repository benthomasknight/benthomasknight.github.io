Abstract classes are the next step up from an interface. They allow for both specifying what must be implemented by a child class, as well as actual implementation like a normal class.

Let implement the following interface with our abstract class.

{% highlight typescript %}
interface IOutput {
  content: Array<string>;
  clear: () => void;
  output: () => void;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This interface specifies a simple string outputter that has:

1. An array of strings to output called **content**
2. A function to clear the content called **clear**
3. A function to send the content called **output**

For our case, lets say we have two output methods we want to be available to us. Our first class will send our content to the console, while our second will write the content to a file. You could write the individual classes as follows:

{% highlight typescript %}
class ConsoleOutput implements IOutput {
  constructor(public content: Array<string>) {}

  clear() {
    this.content = [];
  }

  output() {
    console.log(this.content.join());
  }
}

/* NodeJS file output */
import appendFile from 'fs';

class FileOutput implements IOutput {
  constructor(public content: Array<string>) {}

  clear() {
    this.content = [];
  }
  
  output() {
    appendFile('message.txt', this.content.join());
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Great so this works and we didn't use any abstract classes so what would we need them for? Well you may have also noticed that the code is not very [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). If you haven't hear of the DRY principal it just means *Don't Repeat Youself*. It will save you many headaches over your time as a software developer where you fix a problem, only to find the code was repeated in another area so you have to change it again.

Lets keep things DRY this time by creating a base class to store the clear function.

{% highlight typescript %}
class BaseOutput implements IOutput {
  constructor(public content: Array<string>) {}

  clear() {
    this.content = [];
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

So we have now moved the duplicate code and things are DRY, but we are getting a compiler error because we haven't implemented the output function. We could implement the output function in the base class but it would be a dummy implementation and it doesn't make sense to default output to nowhere. We also want to make it clear to the child class that we expect it to implement the function itself. Ergo we use the abstract keyword.

{% highlight typescript %}
/* Make the class abstract */
abstract class BaseOutput implements IOutput {
  constructor(public content: Array<string>) {}

  clear() {
    this.content = [];
  }

  /* Make the non-implemented functions abstract */
  abstract output(): void;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So now our code compiles successfully and we know that any child class will now be required to implement the output function. Lets finally convert our original output classes to implement this base class.

{% highlight typescript %}
class ConsoleOutput extends BaseOutput {
  output() {
    console.log(this.content.join());
  }
}

/* NodeJS file output */
import appendFile from 'fs';

class FileOutput extends BaseOutput {  
  output() {
    appendFile('message.txt', this.content.join());
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have a group of classes that are DRY, with each bit of functionality seperated out into its correct location. You can see if we need to change the way the content is created we can now change it in a single location and it will work for all child classes. If we need to only change it for a specific class then we can always override it in the child class that requires this.
