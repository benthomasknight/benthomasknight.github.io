Recently I have been working more and more in Typescript. It is a great tool that brings types to javascript, as well as a host of additional Object Oriented helpers such as interfaces.

Since working in javascript in ServiceNow I have been slowely forgetting all the great tools that are available in an Object Oriented languages toolset so I will be running myself through a refresher.

As a side note: I will be using FiraCode for all the code sections here. It is a font with ligatures that changes up what is displayed based on the context of the characters around it. Check it out!

```
lambda operator: =>
3 Equals: ===
Less than or Equals To: <=
HTML Comments: <!-- comment -->
```

Below are all the design principal I have gone through and it will grow as I get to them.
